# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A visual representation of popular sorting algorithms built using Python and Tkinter. This tool demonstrates the step-by-step process of sorting using various algorithms including Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Quick Sort.

## Features
- Merge Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort

Watch how each sorting algorithm operates in real-time with a visual animation!

## Preview

A sample preview of the visualizer in action.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with most Python distributions)

## Installation

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mitray16/Sorting_Algo_Visualizer.git
cd Sorting_Algo_Visualizer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How It Works
1. Select a sorting algorithm from the options available.
2. Watch as the array is sorted visually, with different colors highlighting the sorting process.
   - **Blue**: Unsorted portion
   - **Green**: Sorted portion

## Sorting Algorithms Explained

- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into smaller subarrays and then merges them back together in sorted order.
- **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort**: A simple, in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the list into a sorted and unsorted region and iteratively selects the smallest element from the unsorted region.
- **Quick Sort**: A highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer approach to partition the array into smaller arrays based on a pivot element.
